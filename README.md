Installable components for Yocto development in devcontainers

# yocto-cooker
The [yocto-cooker](https://github.com/cpb-/yocto-cooker/tree/master) project provides a
meta-tool for assembling Yocto builds based on a JSON "menu" file. When enabling this
devcontainer feature you'll need to include some environment variable hints if you want
to automate the build process.
